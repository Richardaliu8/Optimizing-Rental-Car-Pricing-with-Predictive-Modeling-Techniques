# Optimizing-Rental-Car-Pricing-with-Predictive-Modeling-Techniques
Project Overview  
This project aims to optimize pricing strategies for the car rental market around San Francisco and Oakland airports, focusing on data collected from the Student Universe platform. We employed several predictive modeling techniques to determine the best pricing strategy that maximizes profitability and maintains market competitiveness.  

Features  
Data Source: Utilizes detailed car rental data scraped from StudentUniverse.com, covering various attributes like car model, supplier, seating capacity, storage space, and pricing.  
Predictive Modeling: Applies Linear Regression, Lasso Regularization, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost to forecast rental prices and evaluate which model provides the most accurate predictions.  
Comprehensive Analysis: Includes a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of key features and the relationship between different variables.  
Model Comparison: Compares the performance of different models based on out-of-sample root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared values to identify the most effective predictive model.  
Variable Importance: Assesses the importance of various features using techniques like Mean Decrease in Impurity and Permutation Feature Importance, providing insights into which factors most significantly impact rental pricing.  
Business Insights: Delivers strategic insights that enable the company to fine-tune pricing according to market conditions, improving decision-making and enhancing revenue and customer satisfaction.  

Purpose  
The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the pricing strategy for car rentals, leveraging machine learning to analyze and predict optimal price points. By identifying the most predictive factors and the best-performing model, this project aids in refining business strategies, ultimately leading to improved cost efficiency and competitive advantage in the car rental market.
